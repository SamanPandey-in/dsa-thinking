# Data Structures & Algorithms — Problem Solving

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures & Algorithms problems solved across various platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.).

The goal of this repo is not just to store solutions, but to **document learning**.

> Each test case is meant to teach you something.

---

## 📌 Why this repository exists

- To build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- To practice writing clean, readable, and optimized code
- To track progress and learning over time
- To reflect on mistakes and edge cases through test cases

---

## 🧠 How I approach problems

For every problem, I focus on:
1. Understanding constraints and edge cases
2. Writing a brute-force solution (if applicable)
3. Optimizing step-by-step
4. Learning from failing test cases

Each solution file includes:
- Problem statement (short)
- Approach explanation
- Time & space complexity
- Final optimized code
- Each folder contains well-documented solutions.

## 📎 Note

This is an actively maintained repository.
Solutions may evolve as I learn better approaches.

Each test case reveals what your algorithm still doesn’t understand.

Happy coding ✨
